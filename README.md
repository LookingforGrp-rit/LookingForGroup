# How To Run
- Use 'npm i' in the root folder as well as in the client folder to install dependencies
- If working with html and css only, you can use 'npm run client'
- If you need to work with the backend, database or need the api to work then you can use 'npm run server'
- 'npm run server' requires running a 'npm run build' each time you want to see an updated version of the frontend
- Using 'npm run dev' will launch both in separate browser tabs
